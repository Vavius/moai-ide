Actions:
1) Click and select something (objects) - multiple select with cmd
2) Show gizmos - rotate, scale, move
3) Create new objects
4) Undo/redo
5) Get scene hierarchy for tree view


xx) Play the game - switch between different input listeners?


Lua Editor: 
1) Gizmos, interactions
2) Pass selected object properties to python
3) Pass and receive selected object property changes
4) Parse 

MOAI Types: 
1) Default Moai types (Prop, TextBox, Layer)
2) Type inheritance
3) Custom types


Type is defined by Setter/Getter
Since MOAI does not have setter/getter parity, we need to maintain it in lua code.

Add to every pickable MOAI object an "__editor" field (table)

__editor:
{
    type1 = type1,
    type2 = type2,
    type3 = type3,
}

property_declarations:
type:
{
    property = {type = ['string', 'int', 'float', 'vec3', 'color', 'bool', 'list'], get = func(object), set = func(object, value)}
}
